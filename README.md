## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. User selects a language and enters code via the frontend.
2. Backend sends the code to the C++ core engine.
3. The code is executed using:
   - **Python interpreter**
   - **V8 for JavaScript**
   - **MinGW/Bash for shell scripts**
4. Output is captured and sent back to frontend.
